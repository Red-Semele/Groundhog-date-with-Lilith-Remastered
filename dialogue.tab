cafe_food_result_405db8d7	l	I will first roll two dice and tell you the sum of them. If I roll a double so for example if I roll two four's an extra four is added. So every double I roll is effectively a tripple.	game/script/cafe.rpy	54	l "[what]"

cafe_joke_dontGet_f74b632c	l	Oh, the point of the joke is that the other two who entered the bar where religious fiures, the monk and the priest. So the rabbit doesn't quite fit in, it's because he was actually a rabbi instead. So I mispronounced that hence the "did you slip your tongue?" .	game/script/cafe.rpy	322	l "[what]"
cafe_joke_dontGet_7cd3a02c	l	Is the joke now funnier or did it now become less funny? It tends to be that way when you explain a joke so I'm sorry if I ruined it for you.	game/script/cafe.rpy	324	l "[what]"

cafe_badLove_dd421e13	l	I wouldn't say I had really bad experiences with love. It's just that I tend to grow connected with people before they even had the chance to grow fond of me.

cafe_badLove_c4037143	l	It took me a while before I managed to find the courage in myself to try and fix my problems. It didn't happen instantly, even now I sometimes come of as too distant, but little by little I managed to tell myself that there is nothing wrong with not needing an overdose of affection every second.	game/script/cafe.rpy	346	l "[what]"
cafe_badLove_dcb8585d	l	So, did I have bad experiences in love? Maybe, but they were all quite necessary as without them I wouldn't be here with you today, I wouldn't even be myself if that makes sense. Sorry for blabbering on by the way, I'm quite talkative when you get me going.	game/script/cafe.rpy	348	l "[what]"

chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_dab8ddac	l	She really likes to make all kinds of stuff, right now it's mostly games. She can't really code much so she uses Quest, it's a program that makes it easier to make textbased games.	game/script/chinese.rpy	418	l "[what]"

chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_6d8ac5f6	l	Well for one, games made by a small team or even one person are almost an imprint of what those people were thinking right when they made their project.	game/script/chinese.rpy	425	l "[what]"

chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_05b3bfa5	l	It's only one voice in there but they always refer to them as if there are multiples. They keep going on and on about how you are speaking in a "stolen voice" and how no one wants to listen to you. And yet they keep begging you to speak, not because they listen to you or understand your words but because they like the color of your text, light green.	game/script/chinese.rpy	436	l "[what]"
chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_285dc75d	l	The prisoner keeps talking, mostly insulting you and commanding you to bow before them. After what felt like probably ten minutes of pure nonsense reactions to my input another voice began to speak.	game/script/chinese.rpy	439	l "[what]"
chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_865808d6	l	That voice was dark green, It also didn't really pay attention to what I was saying but the prisoner also didn't seem to notice the other voice. It kept calling out for help, repeatedly.	game/script/chinese.rpy	441	l "[what]"

chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_872d23bf	l	There was no one there... Suddenly the door shut and I was locked inside. After a while you begin speaking the same nonsense as the prisoner, in dark blue aswell. That's when the game ends abruptly and turns to black.	game/script/chinese.rpy	446	l "[what]"
chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_dc081091	l	Oh, I've been talking longer than I thought I would, maybe it's better to not talk about the other game then. What do you think [persistent.name]?	game/script/chinese.rpy	451	l "[what]"
chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_14dd7ac7	l	The second game is a lot bigger in the scope of the location. It's about a ravenprince who needs to climb a mountain with his wings bound together.	game/script/chinese.rpy	455	l "[what]"

chinese_riddle_talk_abbyHobbies_32b76933	l	All of those characters discourage you from climbing the mountain, all of them except for the most important character of them all from what I could understand.

chinese_abby_game_theme_loops_aa846302		You might be onto something! The feeder becoming the prisoner and the raven climbing the mountain again and again, those things are cleary loops.

kokiri_explanation_game_playerIdentity_bf1c0f6d	l	What if somehow, after you made up the entire half of the story, it was exactly what the author wrote?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	248	l "[what]"
kokiri_explanation_game_playerIdentity_cd159ee5	l	So theoretically speaking, out of infinite imaginings of the story atleast one will be the one the author intended.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	249	l "[what]"
kokiri_explanation_game_playerIdentity_896ed306	l	I would argue that probably quite a few more of them would be author-intended since the reader has read half of the book. Because of that you can better understand the logic of the world the writer created. So you can make a few estimated guesses about how it all would go. Sure, depending on the complexity of the story you might not be able to interweave the new elements the author would but you'd still be able to get the same end result.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	250	l "[what]"

kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_9f5692c8	l	For us, for me... or for yourself?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	817	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_4305e1df	l	Oh I see...	game/script/kokiri.rpy	820	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_d4a260c1	l	You have to find it for yourself?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	821	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e3205a7c	l	So you don't want it because you crave an impossibly good ending for us like I thought and feared?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	822	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_557bb654	l	It's even worse than I thought... you're just needlessly throwing my lives away to see if there is anything that can saturate your unrelenting need for greater things.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	823	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e6b233c7	l	Let me tell you a secret [persistent.name], it will never be enough for you.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	824	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_d4bdf738	l	Although I suppose that that is not so much a secret to you as you would like it to be.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	825	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_af0485e5	l	That feeling of chasing something impossible, you have already grown quite familiar with that, right?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	826	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_4dc59424	l	Well, let me tell you something else you already know.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	827	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_ead38ad2	l	I won't remember this conversation the next time you talk to me but you will, whether you like it or not, that is my curse to you.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	828	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_ce7e9812	l	I'm not sure if it'll have much effect on someone so selfish... but if you ever played this game to try to save me, not for you and I to be together but just to save me, then it might be worth a shot.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	829	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_cd1381f6	l	Goodbye [persistent.name], until we inevitably meet again.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	830	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_47e97f88	l	Oh [persistent.name]... can't we just make our own good ending?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	835	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_4544a881	l	What's stopping us from becoming our own storytellers?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	836	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_f88207a0	l	Can't you see [persistent.name]? This is my good ending.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	843	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_fa3ec88f	l	I get to spend some quality time with you right here and right now, that's all I need.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	844	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_db940e5f	l	If we just trick ourselves into not seeing the way the game is trying to push us this night was very nice, wasn't it?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	845	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_19c8ffd4	l	So is this not a good enough good ending for you?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	846	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e57f4595	l	Try to enjoy it, try to have some fun. Do it for me [persistent.name], do it for us.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	847	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_3e50904e	l	Thank you [persistent.name], I appreciate it more than I could probably show...	game/script/kokiri.rpy	853	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_64bd4e9a	l	Because you could just retry and retry without me knowing wheter you promised to stop or not, that is what gives your promise power, or rather... the potential of power.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	854	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_b2558679	l	And in my trust in you lies a different power.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	855	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_dc6bc75e	l	Let's hope that our combined power is enough to get through this.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	856	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_af95c737	l	But, about that good ending you were trying to find, do you think it truly exists?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	857	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e8266646	l	I suppose you are right in a way...	game/script/kokiri.rpy	860	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_2b61b930	l	But wouldn't it give you closure if you knew there the good ending you are seeking does not exist?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	861	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_c5449648	l	But then again, what if there truly was one...	game/script/kokiri.rpy	862	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_cbd1a6f9	l	Forget I mentioned that please!	game/script/kokiri.rpy	863	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_1975b436	l	Well, that just gives me more questions than answers. If you know the good ending exists then why are you still searching it?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	868	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_84c30c1f	l	Ah, so there are others that also played this game and found the good ending?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	872	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_3de7729f	l	But that only gives me more questions than answers honestly.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	873	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_5b85c471	l	If you have read about the good ending, then why were you coming here to read about it once again but in this world?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	874	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_1c77993d	l	Is reading about the good ending not the same thing as playing it yourself? It's not like you'll be surprised by it anymore, right?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	875	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_3ee62d09	l	Then why are you searching for something that you know doesn't exist?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	881	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_ee52252e	l	I suppose that makes some sense... but that seems like a terrible way to go through the motions.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	885	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_73a513d1	l	You were essentially sacrificing both your time and my lives for a goal you do not even know exists on the off chance that it might be real.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	886	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_abfb4c26	l	I'm glad you managed to come to your senses and wanted to listen to me. Thank you for that, [persistent.name]!	game/script/kokiri.rpy	887	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e6d68624	l	Lilith grows silent for a moment.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	888	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_f738af55	l	Now that you mention that, that's actually a very interesting question.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	894	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_65870393	l	How would the definitive good ending of this game look?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	895	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_f7190075	l	I mean, I think I would probably survive in the good ending, right?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	896	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_3250cbcf	l	And you would probably be able to be with me without risk of dying.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	897	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_17e6bb72	l	Or maybe you would learn a lesson about aceptance or something like that.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	898	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_d5f41ff7	l	Honestly, I think it might be the latter. From what I've heard so far it seems a bit hard to believe there might even be a good ending like that somewhere in this game.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	900	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_5ad7bf20	l	But it's not like it matters much anymore.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	901	l "[what]"

kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_440514ca	n	Lilith shudders for a moment.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	915	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_b5df7e54	l	Let's not think about that too much, just give me more to remember instead.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	916	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_b1f37be7	n	She lays down and softly places her head on your lap.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	917	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_d675151e	l	The stars are all so beautiful right now, it's like I'm seeing them for the first time all over again.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	918	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_028efe6c	l	I'm not sure I understand, what do you mean with that [persistent.name]?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	921	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_2a3c09ce	l	Hmm, I suppose that might be the case but haven't you been here before when you were playing the game?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	925	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_a594b250	l	And if you have, doesn't that mean that I was with you and that I watched the stars that time?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	926	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_d66317a7	l	Well, for whatever it is worth, it still feels like the first time to me. Partially because I can't remember the previous time but I think even if I could it would always feel like that to me.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	929	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e78a98c1	l	It's special because I get to spend that time with you. I hope that this moment won't get old for you aswell, that you will enjoy it as much as the first time we watched the stars together.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	930	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_c58c81a2	l	Oh right, because this game is textbased for you. Well, I could narrate the stars if you want to.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	936	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_a9672b65	n	You give a quick nod.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	937	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_dfd1d5fd	l	Alright, here we go.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	938	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_f7b93566	l	The stars shine like silver lights in the inkblack sky, they seem to form patterns if you look closely enough.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	939	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_1cf35654	l	You can see a pan with a bent handle, a bathtub, a playful dog and a snake.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	940	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_6e53b032	l	Am I doing a good job narrating?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	941	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_dcab9476	n	You give her a thumbs up and she gives you a smile in return.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	942	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_fc36e540	l	Alright, I'll narrate some more then, this is pretty fun!	game/script/kokiri.rpy	943	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_5f84c9be	l	You can see a few falling stars, their tails of light are a visible trace of the projection from the past that uses the star itself in the present to project itself to the future, to beyond the place the star currently resides in.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	944	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_5d3a8ef2	l	This constant and neverending process is happening multiple times every single second. Your head hurts trying to think of it too much so you just try to enjoy the falling stars for their beauty.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	945	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_5385ee83	l	As you are doing so you begin to think of this projection method once again. Isn't the future itself just a projection of the past memories using the present as a projection point?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	946	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_95109412	l	Are we doomed to always make the same choices because our past steers us towards our future wich inevitably becomes our past that steers us even more?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	947	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_03b9a920	l	Or are we more like billiard balls being pushed by our past in a predictable direction until we collide with other billiard balls that push us in a different direction?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	948	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_cb7c3ac1	l	If we are like the billiard balls, can it be predicted wich ones will push us where? Or is the number of balls so incomprehensible that it brings a form of chaos with it?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	949	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_4ff8a315	n	You try to calm Lilith down a little by softly placing your hand on hers.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	950	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_9f959cbc	l	Whoops, I think I might have went a little too far into my narration role there for a moment. 	game/script/kokiri.rpy	951	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_fd8f9431	n	As one narrator to another, I think it happens to the best of us. It's hard to keep a story on tracks sometimes.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	952	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_a76d08c1	n	But technically, that was still part of the story, and it was beautiful.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	953	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_dbaa23ea	l	It's just some stuff I've been wondering for a while, maybe even more so now that I know I live in a simulated world.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	954	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_85523dec	l	What do you think about what I just said [persistent.name]?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	955	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_49f59a7a	l	Is our future predictable, even just in theory?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	956	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_188408c5	n	Honestly staying silent probably was the best call, I mean have you {b}seen{/b} some of the other options?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	961	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_1aec87ae	n	It's probably not the best idea to constantly bring up something philosopical on your first date.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	962	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_6bda5893	n	Well... for her it's the first date. For you it's becoming hard to keep track of how many first dates you had with her isn't it?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	963	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_67d8e26a	n	I'll help you out, it's somewhere around the [persistent.lildeaths]th date for you.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	964	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_94443a8d	n	But anyway, I just wanted to say that I'm proud of you for not saying too much, that is my job afterall.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	965	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_ca92f83a	n	Let me jump right back into the narration.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	966	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_5372c85e	n	You're not sure how long you two have been staring at the stars, it might have been a minute or fifteen of them. All you're sure about is that you felt at peace for every second of it.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	967	n "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_6d86a113	l	Thank you for making these memories with me [persistent.name] even if I won't remember them the next time, I'll remember them for as long as I possibly can.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	968	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_9d82fbb8	l	I had a blast so far, even if the concept that I'm in a game still is a bit much to wrap my head around.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	969	l "[what]"
kokiri_death_dialogue_stillDying_e24db2ab	l	I was always so focused on Abby, mom, my work, pretty much anything else that isn't me, that I forgot how good it feels to take some time to just relax.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	970	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_54477c93	n	Lilith chuckles and gives you a confused look.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	974	n "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_b0e066a5	l	I'm afraid I'm not really following you [persistent.name].	game/script/kokiri.rpy	975	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_c516f04b	l	If you were at the exact same place and time with a version of me and you told her the same things you are telling me up to this point, doesn't that make me essentially her?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	976	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_23d8f444	l	Ah I hadn't thought about it like that!	game/script/kokiri.rpy	979	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_8f39022f	l	I guess I feel like a different person to you depending on what you learn about me but unlike me you can't forget it.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	980	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_50a4a24c	l	It's almost like that saying I suppose: "You can't step into the same river twice."	game/script/kokiri.rpy	981	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_d5170472	l	Do you know who said that?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	982	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_743ef9c3	l	You remember Lilith telling you it was Heraclitus who said that.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	984	l "[what]"

kokiri_notTheSameYou_3e7c7532	l	No worries [persistent.name]! It's not like I'm going to leave you because you don't know the name of that guy.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	993	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_5827fd52	n	Lilith chuckles slightly.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	994	n "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_05036bc8	l	He believed that everything flows and moves, that nothing stays the same. I believe the right words are: "Panta rhei"	game/script/kokiri.rpy	995	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_4cbd1218	l	I think he certainly has a point, especially when you start to think of all the cogs and parts that interact with eachother every single second of our lives and even beyond them.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	996	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_529fa2b5	l	Then again, I wonder if you put those exact cogs and parts in the exact same place and under the same circumstances if you would get other results or if everything would go the same way.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	997	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_512805dd	l	I tend to believe the latter, what do you think [persistent.name]?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	998	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_436a0aee	l	I always found that a fascinating thing to ponder, if you had two universes that so far are identical in every way. Can they go in different directions?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1005	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_7484a8fd	l	Or is there such a thing as fate always steering them in the same direction?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1006	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_1d398054	l	I believe they would follow the same direction if every single little detail up to that point was the same but that's the fun part in this whole speculation, the idea that I could be wrong!	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1007	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_dce03e3b	n	You give Lilith a questioning look and she burst out in laughter.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1008	n "[what]"

kokiri_notTheSameYou_e98d0dbb	l	Where would be the fun if I could just know how the universe itself worked? I think it is way more interesting to try to think of new interesting ways that can be explained with logic than to just cling to it being unknowable as an excuse to not think of explanations. Don't you think so aswell [persistent.name]?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1010	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_e5f11f53	l	I know [persistent.name], but are you sure I have to die here?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1017	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_e63c4c43	l	Can't you just ask me the same questions you need to ask me somewhere where I die a less painful death?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1018	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_9791c16d	l	Or maybe even preferably ask me those questions over the phone so I don't have to die?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1019	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_347c140a	l	Alright, I understand. But are you sure there is something more than this?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1023	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_12f72f3b	l	Am I dying over and over again for a purpose?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1024	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_a3a6e7d4	l	Or are you just doing this to speak to me once again no matter what it costs?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1025	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_657c47df	l	I'm not blaming you if you are, I just want you to tell me the truth.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1026	l "[what]"

kokiri_notTheSameYou_99cd2e2e	l	Or maybe you didn't do it yourself but someone else found something beyond and you wanted to check for yourself? That also seems strange to me, isn't reading about what lies beyond this moment the same as seeing it for yourself here? Are both options not equally real to you?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1034	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_4f6247c7	l	We don't need to go through all of this, [persistent.name]. You know I'll always be with you as long as you can remember me, right?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1041	l "[what]"

kokiri_notTheSameYou_fec045ab	l	So that probably gives you a good grasp on how I am as a person, what I would do in certain situations, how I see the world. 	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1044	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_fa77e599	l	Could you not use that to see me again? Use those memories you have of me as a mini-me you can carry in your heart and who you can take with you wherever you want?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1045	l "[what]"
kokiri_notTheSameYou_66f2a3d1	l	Due to my nature I reckon the extra time you can spend with me now will soon lose it's charm once you have spent it. And what would happen then? What would happen once you've read all the things I can say?	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1046	l "[what]"
