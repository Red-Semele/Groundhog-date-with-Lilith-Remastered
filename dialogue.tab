kokiri_explanation_game_playerIdentity_896ed306	l	I would argue that probably quite a few more of them would be author-intended since the reader has read half of the book. Because of that you can better understand the logic of the world the writer created. So you can make a few estimated guesses about how it all would go. Sure, depending on the complexity of the story you might not be able to interweave the new elements the author would but you'd still be able to get the same end result.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	239	l "[what]"

kokiri_talkAboutSomethingElse_d8c22edf	l	In other words, a good picture should almost become a video with the picture as it's first frame.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	714	l "[what]"
kokiri_talkAboutSomethingElse_268c96b6	l	Personally I aways thought the oposite, a good picture makes you remember the lead-up to that picture, so in a way a good picture is a video with the picture as it's last frame.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	715	l "[what]"
kokiri_talkAboutSomethingElse_fd22b6df	l	I think that's the only reason I can look at a picture of James without tearing up completely. I just see the lead-up to the picture and not the horifying aftermath of it all.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	716	l "[what]"
kokiri_talkAboutSomethingElse_c0605d78	l	However badly the memory of the aftermath still haunts me, I can't let that be the only part of his life I remember.

kokiri_semiEnding_d5f41ff7	l	Honestly, I think it might be the latter. From what I've heard so far it seems a bit hard to believe there might even be a good ending like that somewhere in this game.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1360	l "[what]"

kokiri_semiEnding_d66317a7	l	Well, for whatever it is worth, it still feels like the first time to me. Partially because I can't remember the previous time but I think even if I could it would always feel like that to me.	game/script/kokiri.rpy	1392	l "[what]"

ufo_crash_polaroids_James_c1c316a8	j	Those abandoned worlds are still out there, [name]. I know that because I can see them, I am watching over the infinite worlds that exist in this game.	game/script/script.rpy	1730	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_6dadbc26	j	This place is the weakest link to every world, a sort of dying breath of those worlds. Here it is possible for souls to linger instead of crossing over into the Darkness.	game/script/script.rpy	1731	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_a0ef041c	j	There is only one Darkness but there are many versions of this place. So through the Darkness every world is linked together and since we can observe the Darkness here we can observe the other worlds aswell.	game/script/script.rpy	1732	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_ea06d6b2	j	I have seen many more worlds than you have crossed.	game/script/script.rpy	1733	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_2e2ac303	j	I have seen many other crossers, I have even talked to some of them before.	game/script/script.rpy	1734	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_0d880d1c	j	I have changed some of their minds, made them see this game as more than just a game.	game/script/script.rpy	1735	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_e36114d2	j	But that also didn't work for quite a few of them.	game/script/script.rpy	1736	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_4b533421	j	And now you are here and I am telling you the same thing as I was telling the previous ones, as I will tell the next ones.	game/script/script.rpy	1737	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_8d472c22	j	It all seems pointless sometimes if I'm being entirely honest with you. You are stuck in a loop, right?	game/script/script.rpy	1738	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_e3096825	j	And you hope that once you break out of it you will be able to move on to the next day.	game/script/script.rpy	1739	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_1f488076	j	Well for me that next day always comes but the loop follows suit.	game/script/script.rpy	1740	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_2bb698f3	j	I never get the luxury of dreaming what will happen when I get out of the loop, this place is my loop.	game/script/script.rpy	1741	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_680df73c	j	The only way to break it would be to enter the Darkness but I'm not ready for that yet, I need to know that Lilith is happy and safe.	game/script/script.rpy	1742	j "[what]"
ufo_crash_polaroids_James_699184df	j	And for a brief moment I thought you wanted the same thing [name] but if that was truly the case, then why did you retry even after getting an ending where she was happy and alive?	game/script/script.rpy	1743	j "[what]"

jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_107d742e	j	But who do you want to reach the ending for?	game/script/script.rpy	1755	j "[what]"
jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_17e1b461	j	You just take whatever you want to mold it into whichever way you please.	game/script/script.rpy	1756	j "[what]"
jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_be45d14b	j	Don't you think you are being unfair to Lilith? Don't you think she has the right to die only once?	game/script/script.rpy	1757	j "[what]"
jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_037540a1	j	I also don't like to see her die but you are just making things worse.	game/script/script.rpy	1758	j "[what]"

jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_622785fc	j	Every time you retry you get transported to a parallel instance of this world with the new knowledge you gained.	game/script/script.rpy	1761	j "[what]"
jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_7d721cb7	j	You can however only do so much in those parallel versions of the world as they are copies, they don't tend to vary much.	game/script/script.rpy	1762	j "[what]"
jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_d116c1aa	j	To get more variation, limitless and controlable variation even, you would need to not be bound to <u>them</u>.anymore.	game/script/script.rpy	1763	j "[what]"

jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_acc1701d	j	When Lilith met Ron and they were happy together, even had some kids.	game/script/script.rpy	1771	j "[what]"

jamesChat_whyDidYouReturn_toBeTogether_choices_2bfd438d	j	The first one you probably haven't met, not for long anyway. He is the one that created this world, gave you acces to it and made the second one. The second one you might know actually, the jester that controls the flow and direction of our story.
