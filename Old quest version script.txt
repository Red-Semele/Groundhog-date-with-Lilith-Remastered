      msg ("Each of them has a piece of a synthetic soul in them. <br/>The synthetic soul was designed based on a lingering soul in what we have dubbed: \" The Light\" <br/>The Light is a very bright place that is given form by the souls that didn't want to move into The Darkness and instead lingered right before it.")
      msg ("We first noticed The Light when we were running a simulation of another world during (Give another project name here). The Light was not programmed to appear but it somehow did anyway.")

Using the lingering soul's soul as a blueprint for a synthetic soul we hope they will answer the call of the Light for us.<br/>To acomplish this we needed to prime their actions by running a constructed simulation with them in it. That way they can cultivate their soul and thoughts the way we need them to.")

We might need to remove her aswell.")
      msg ("#9: Subject keeps awakening and attempting to escape. Resetting him did not do anything. We stacked several simulations on top of eachother and trapped him in the deepest one in order to keep him from escaping before his soul is fully grown. This might be wasted effort unfortunately as he is not friendly with us and doesn't seem to be willing to help us with our mission. We mostly keep him around to observe this strange phenomenon.")

Try to prevent this from spreading to the others.<br/>Our current hypothesis is that this is possible because the programming pods are next each other but we need to do further testing to confirm this.")
      msg ("#14: Subject seems to have split itself into two beings, each with only half of a soul. In the simulation they each have their own body.<br/>We need to test the effects of only programming one half of the soul. This is very intriguing.")
